Topic<br><br>

The purpose of this project is to solve the problem that save data cannot be transferred across game consoles and computers. Also, game save data on one game console cannot be read by another game console because they are in different formats. Our project will make game save data more accessible cross platform and make it, so the data can be understood by both platforms.<br>  

In order to accomplish these goals, we will need to be able to take the files from one console and then reformat them, so they can be read by the other game console. Then there needs to be a way to move the file from one game console to the other. This can be done with a memory device such as a flash drive or a memory card. But we would like to store the data on the could as that will make the data accessible to any device that is connected to the internet.<br><br>

Motivation<br><br>

The main motivation that this idea stemmed from was when a few team members face this issue for their game where they have multiple copies of the same game for different platforms. However, countless hours spent in the progression of one game on a specific platform cannot be transferred to another platform progression in the game. Leaving my team members frustrated that we want to extend a solution to make all games to be cross save data accessible on any platform available.<br><br> 

 

Landscape<br><br>

The current landscape for this technology implementation in the market, existent of one competitor which is Microsoft Xbox. However, the currently offering from Xbox is its limited to their own library of games and only allow PC and Xbox cross platform play and cross saves. Currently only some games enable cross saves within an eco-system like PC only. Others uses the Play Station eco-system. Lastly the Xbox ecosystem. But mostly the landscape is currently divided as game development studios are only releasing this feature as an extra bonus to the game themselves such as either cross-play platform or cross-save or both. While eco-system such as Microsoft have developed Xbox play anywhere to allow users to play selected digital titles that can be play on both PC Windows 10 and Xbox One.<br>  

The project the team at Scorpion plan to do is different from the competition because the plan is to enable a software that breaches the gap between all platform and enable a developer centric model where game studio developers can customise the use of our software to enable game save data to be converted and ported from one platform like PC to another platform like Console while save data playable at both ends.
